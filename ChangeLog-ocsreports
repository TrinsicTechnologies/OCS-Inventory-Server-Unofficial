	When opening the Date Time Picker in the administrative data for an inventoried computer, the year comes up as 2005. I tracked down the problem to the file /usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/js/datetimepicker.js on line 108 the date is being reset to 2005. I fixed this problem in my own installation by adding a line 109 that reads "Cal.Year = dtToday.getFullYear();", however it would be nice if it were fixed in subsequent versions. Thanks,

2010-01-27  Paul Simons  <simonsp@calumet.purdue.edu>

	Changed an sql statement in doublons.php so that if a computer does not have a mac address, it does not dissapear from hostname or serial listings.  Currently if a comptuer does not have a mac address, and it had the same serial or hostname as a computer that had a mac address, only that computer would show up in the doublons report.  It was then impossible to merge a computer that did not have a network adapter before, and has one now.

	merge Paul Simons changes

2010-01-20  Paul Simons  <simonsp@calumet.purdue.edu>

	The changes that have been made address the following issue.
	
	When a computer is inventoried using a local standalone audit 
	on one subnet, it stays on that subnet in the ipdiscover page. 
	If the computer is moved to a different subnet, it still does 
	not show up on the new subnet at all, even though it exists in 
	the netmap table on the new subnet. The changes in the 
	ipdiscover file modify it so that the inventoried subnet and 
	the scanned subnet are compared for each mac address. If the 
	subnets are not equal, the computer is now listed as 
	non-inventoried. This is done through only modifying sql 
	statements.
	
	The statements that have been modified are as follows:
	The two statements that give the total have been modified 
	to compare subnets.
	The statement that selects non-inventoried for each subnet 
	has been modified to not exclude all inventoried mac 
	address, but only inventoried mac address on that subnet.
	The statement that lists the non-inventoried computers has 
	been modified the same way.
	
	All modifications have comments before them.
